# Embedded-System

##System 

    --Arrangement or a way of working

##Embedded System 

    --Something that is attached to another thing or 
    --Independent System/ part of a large system

##Component of Embedded System

    1 - Hardware 
    2 - Software
    3 - RTOS(realtime operating system) -- used of provide set of rules like automation always there for large scale embedded system

##Characteristic of Embedded System

    1 - Single Functioned --> Need for specific function or work to do 
    2 - Tightly Constrained --> as per cost , size , perfomance , power etc 
    3 - Realtime Operation --> Continuosly sensed enviroment(sensors used) and do tasks on realime (no delay should be there)
    4 - Microprocessors / Microcontroller based --> It should be application specific processor/controller not the general purpose
    5 - Connected(Peripherals) --> like input and output to connect 
    6 - Software --> for more features and flexibility
    7 - Hardware --> for perfomance and security



#Embedded System Processors

##Processors 
    Mainly used for processing like any input to give some specific output

##Processors inside a system
